We can get binaries for nexus devices at 'https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers?csw=1'
However Google and LG omited binaries about HDCP. So if you don't add this binaries, you can't execute phonetop project.

If you get your nexus 5, you have to run script_pull file.

or change file device-partial.mk in '<AOSP root>/vendor/lge/hammerhead' to device-partial.mk in this project directory
